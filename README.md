# Neural Networks and Deep Learning: Homeworks & Projects
Homeworks and Project of NNDL course at University of Tehran

## Context
For two semesters at the University of Tehran, I worked with Dr. Ahmad Kalhor as Head T.A. of Neural network and Deep learning course.

During those semesters, I supervised and collaborated with almost twenty talented teaching assistants, which leads to the designing and publishing of 17 homework and projects.

## Content
In this repository, I'm making those assignments available to everyone.

P.S. assignments are written in Persian; so if you are interested in having them in other languages and want help to translate them, be in touch with me using the iamthehamed@gmail.com address.
